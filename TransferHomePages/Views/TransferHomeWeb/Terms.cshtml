Data collected by us as part of the Services will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Notice and Cookie Policy.

            <!--5. Use of services and cost-->
            <h4 class="sub-heading">5. Use of services and cost</h4>
            <p>To use the Services, you agree to comply with and undertake the provisions set out in this Section 6.</p>
            <p>The Services shall only be provided to you by TransferHome© in respect of the mobile phone operators and service providers available on the Applications (which are subject to change and availability).</p>
            <p>You will be required to input certain information (e.g. a mobile phone number) in respect of the Services on the Applications. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have correctly inputted the information. In the case of Top-up, you will then be required to select the amount of Top-up that you wish to be delivered.</p>
            <p>The total amount (inclusive of all applicable taxes and charges) that you will be required to pay will be displayed clearly on the Applications before you are asked to confirm your transaction and proceeding with the transaction at this point is entirely optional. In the case of Top-up, the cost will vary depending on the amount of Top-up that you wish to send according to the denominations displayed on the Applications. Where an exchange rate has been applied the actual amount that you are charged may vary as our payment processors’ FX rate may be slightly different at the time of settlement. You may also be charged a secure online processing fee in respect of any Service you purchase through the Applications. If you choose to send an optional SMS to the recipient of Top-up, an additional message fee for this may apply.</p>
            <p>A Service is sent by TransferHome© via the relevant third party (e.g. mobile operator) upon successful payment by you. Occasionally, there may be a short delay before the relevant third party delivers the Service. Where contact details have been provided, we will send you a confirmation email or SMS which contains details of the Services sent as soon as your transaction has been successfully completed. You agree and understand that TransferHome© only acts on your authorisation to send Services and the relevant third party shall be solely liable to you and the recipient of the Services for the provision of Services. In the case of Top-up, once it is sent to the recipient, it can be used immediately and therefore it cannot be refunded or removed. To avoid a Service being sent to the wrong phone or place, TransferHome© asks you to confirm that the recipient details you have entered are correct.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that you will lose the right to cancel the Services once they have been fully performed by TransferHome©. Accordingly, you will have no right to request a refund. Please note that the Applications limit the amount and value of Services that can be purchased over a specific time period (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly). Other limits and exclusions related to the use of the Applications may be applicable from time to time (which you will be notified of).</p>
            <!--6. Your instructions-->
            <h4 class="sub-heading">6. Your instructions</h4>
            <p>You shall ensure that all instructions provided to TransferHome© through the Applications are accurate, complete and true. In particular, the mobile phone number to which any Top-up is to be credited must be correctly identified. You shall ensure that the instructions which are relayed back for confirmation are correct, accurate and true. All confirmed instructions are final and binding upon you. TransferHome© and/or its service providers shall bear no liability or consequences related to the provision of incorrect, inaccurate or false information by you. You are solely responsible for any consequences related to the failure to provide correct, accurate and true information or the failure to correct such inaccurate information prior to final confirmation.</p>
            <!--7. Transactions using your chosen payment method -->
            <h4 class="sub-heading">7. Transactions using your chosen payment method </h4>
            <p>You may purchase the Services using Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and physical vouchers and any future payment methods available on the Applications. Any credit card, debit card or other payment method which may be used on the Applications must have a valid billing address and valid issuing bank or other payment services provider.</p>
            <p>Upon receipt of a proper and complete request from you for Services, TransferHome© will charge the payment method provided by you and will forward an electronic request to the relevant third party provider (e.g. mobile operator) to provide the Services in the amount transferred, for the benefit of the recipient nominated by you.</p>
            <p>You authorize TransferHome© to act upon any instruction to charge the payment method provided by you through the Applications which has been transmitted using your password and/or any other authentication/identity verification process which you may require to be used in connection with the Applications. TransferHome© is not required to undertake any additional authentication or identity verification measures other than those TransferHome© deems appropriate and sufficient to protect the security and maintain the proper use of the Applications. All charges concluded post successful authentication or identity verification are your sole responsibility and liability.</p>
            <p>TransferHome© shall accept liability for the non-execution or defective execution of Services purchased through the Applications, subject to your adherence with this Agreement, the proper use of the Applications as instructed by TransferHome©, and the absence of any misrepresentation, fraud or negligence by you. Such liability, if incurred, shall be strictly limited to the amount of the unexecuted or defective Services.</p>
            <!--8. Promotions-->
            <h4 class="sub-heading">8. Promotions</h4>
            <p>From time to time, TransferHome© or partner mobile operators will run promotions on the Applications.

TransferHome© is not responsible for promotions run by partner mobile operators and you must make your own inquiries with the relevant mobile operator directly before availing of, and relying on the terms and conditions of, any such promotion.</p>
            <!--9. Your obligations-->
            <h4 class="sub-heading">9. Your obligations</h4>
            <p>The equipment and devices necessary to access the Applications shall be provided and be maintained by you solely at your expense. If you access the Applications through a mobile device you may be charged by your mobile service provider for internet access on your device.</p>
            <p>You can download the mobile applications from the app stores free of charge. TransferHome© reserves the right to modify equipment and software requirements as is necessary for it to continue or improve the provision of Services through the mobile applications. You are solely responsible for ensuring that you download any subsequent updates to the mobile applications from the relevant app store.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that compliance with this Agreement is designed to minimize the risk of unauthorised use of the Applications and therefore you are required to strictly adhere to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you will be liable for any liability, loss, costs or damages, to TransferHome© or any third party as a result of your failure to adhere to this Agreement.</p>
            <!--10. Third party services and information -->

            <p>Some of the Services which may be offered for sale, through the Applications or through other services that TransferHome© may offer you, may be submitted, created, provided or developed by third parties.</p>
            <p>TransferHome© will not check the accuracy or completeness of the information or the suitability or quality of the products and services offered by third parties. You must make your own inquiries with the relevant third-party supplier directly before relying on the third party information or entering into a transaction in relation to the third party products and services referred to on the Applications.</p>
